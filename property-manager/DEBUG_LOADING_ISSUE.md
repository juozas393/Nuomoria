# 🔍 DEBUG: LOADING ISSUE INVESTIGATION

## **DEBUGGING LOGS ADDED**

I've added temporary debugging logs to identify why the "Pagrindinis" page is stuck on "Kraunama...":

### **DataContext Debug Logs:**
- `🔍 DataContext loadData called` - Shows if user object is available
- `🔍 No user, setting loading to false` - Shows when no user is detected
- `🔍 Using cached data, setting loading to false` - Shows when cache is used
- `🔍 Starting data load, setting loading to true` - Shows when data loading begins
- `🔍 Data loaded successfully` - Shows successful data loading with counts
- `🔍 Error loading data` - Shows any errors during data loading
- `🔍 Setting loading to false in finally block` - Shows when loading states are reset

### **Dashboard Debug Logs:**
- `🔍 Dashboard loading states` - Shows current loading states and user status

## **WHAT TO CHECK:**

1. **Refresh the page** and open browser console
2. **Look for these patterns:**

### **Pattern 1: No User Object**
```
🔍 DataContext loadData called: { user: false, userId: undefined }
🔍 No user, setting loading to false
🔍 Dashboard loading states: { propertiesLoading: false, addressesLoading: false, isLoading: false, user: false }
```
**→ If you see this, the user authentication is failing**

### **Pattern 2: User Available, Data Loading**
```
🔍 DataContext loadData called: { user: true, userId: 'f7bd4dc7-...' }
🔍 Starting data load, setting loading to true
🔍 Data loaded successfully: { properties: 0, addresses: 0 }
🔍 Setting loading to false in finally block
🔍 Dashboard loading states: { propertiesLoading: false, addressesLoading: false, isLoading: false, user: true }
```
**→ If you see this, everything should work normally**

### **Pattern 3: Stuck Loading**
```
🔍 DataContext loadData called: { user: true, userId: 'f7bd4dc7-...' }
🔍 Starting data load, setting loading to true
🔍 Dashboard loading states: { propertiesLoading: true, addressesLoading: true, isLoading: true, user: true }
(No "Setting loading to false" message)
```
**→ If you see this, the database queries are hanging or failing**

### **Pattern 4: Error During Loading**
```
🔍 DataContext loadData called: { user: true, userId: 'f7bd4dc7-...' }
🔍 Starting data load, setting loading to true
🔍 Error loading data: [error details]
🔍 Setting loading to false in finally block
```
**→ If you see this, there's a database/network error**

## **NEXT STEPS:**

Based on what you see in the console, I can:

1. **Fix authentication issues** if user object is missing
2. **Fix database query issues** if queries are hanging
3. **Fix error handling** if there are specific errors
4. **Remove debug logs** once the issue is identified and fixed

**Please refresh the page and share what debug logs you see in the console!** 🔍
